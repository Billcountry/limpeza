            <p>we have witnessed tremendous success in developments of upmarket apartments, townhouses,
                villas
                and office blocks most of which are 100% sold prior to ground-breaking. </p>

            <p>Our reputation for attention to detail, personalized service and unique innovations in this
                field
                has gained us strength and a niche position as development consultants. As an over spill
                from
                the core development, we have in turn gained from re-sales, rentals of units and property
                management after completion.</p>
